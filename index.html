          <p>It must be 30 years since my good friend Austin first introduced me to the wonders and delights of the arcane pursuit of fly <a href="#" class="sm-fish-hover">fishing.<img class="sm-fish-hover-image" src="https://www.navaboats.com/media/16691/fishing.jpg?height=350&mode=crop"></a> (That man has a lot to answer for.) He invited me to accompany him for an evening’s dry fly fishing for brown trout on the River Liffey just outside Dublin. Despite the terrifying experience of wading waist-deep across a steadily flowing river in darkness, I was captivated by the whole process and the paraphernalia – the rods, the reels, the lines, the flies – wondrous concoctions of furs, feathers, floss and tinsel and the thrill of accurately and delicately casting your fly to a rising trout. It rises and takes your fly. You raise the rod sharply. The line tightens, and the rod bends. Then battle commenes.</p>
          <p>For many years, some friends of mine – all incurable optimists – joined me for the three-day pilgrimage in the second half of May to Ireland’s great western lakes, Lough Mask and Lough Corrib, for the ritual that is mayfly fishing. We would stay in Eddie Lynch’s Fairhill House Hotel in Clonbur, and evening were spent in the residents’ lounge, our voices raised in song accompanied by Simon and Austin on guitar. Every morning, we would call in to Kathleen’s little tackle shop across the road to browse amond the Folden Olive Bumbles, the Blae Winged sooty Olives and the Claret Dabblers in hopes of finding that killer fly. Then off to Rosshill Bay or Jacky Molloy’s boatyard where our ghillies (boatmen) awaited us.</p>

          <p>They were weather-beaten chiseled old men like Tommy Melia and Michael O’Donnell, who bore themselves with great dignity. And where stealth was required and they did not wish to use the outbound, these men were well able to row their 18-foor clinker-built boats with twp anglers and all their kit onboard.</p>
          <p>Naturally, you’ve come a week too early or too late. The weather is too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry, too bright or too dull, too windy or too calm and not even the liars are catching fish. Nonetheless, your child-like optimism underiminished, you set out hoping the fishing gods will smile on you. Out on the water, the scenery is spectaculatr. To the West lies the awesome grandeur of Maamtrasna, where the mountains rise sheer out of the lake in green and purple and brown. The location is stunning, but alas the fish is not what it used to be. There was a time when it was so easy to catch tought at mayfly time that these two weeks at the beginning of the fishing season were called ‘Duffers’ Fortnight’.</p>
          <p>There is much speculation as to the cause of the decline in the fishing but no real idea of solution. None theless, before I hang up my rods and wanders for the last time, I hope my friends and I will make one last pilfrimage to this spot that has a special place in my heart. Maybe next time there, I’ll catch the big one – I think I may try a Grey Wulff or maybe a French Partridge Mayfly ...	</p>
